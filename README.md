# Data converting hellhole
This is a broken attempt to use Python to convert user inputs into other data types.
This fails as currently, strings cannot be convereted into numbers due to lack of basis for what each letter should represent.

It's possible that by manually assigning values to letters I could make this work, however that's currently a task for another day.

I have no intention to return to this anytime soon.
